            <p class="text-5xl">Disturbance</p>
            <p class="text-md mt-2">A disturbance is an event that changes the organism makeup of an ecosystem, supporting the **non equilibrium model** because disturbances are constantly changing communities.</p>

            <p class="text-3xl mt-8">Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis</p>
            <p class="text-md mt-2">Moderate levels of disturbance create more diversity than either small or high levels. This is because high levels of disturbance totally shatter ecosystems and small levels of disturbance often only harm certain groups, allowing other existing groups to take over, thereby reducing diversity.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-1">High levels of disturbance</p>
            <p class="text-md mt-1">High levels of disturbance, such as natural forest fires, can also be beneficial in healing an environment</p>
        
            <p class="text-3xl mt-8">Ecological Succession</p>
            <p class="text-md mt-2">Ecological succession is when a disturbed area's existing community is replaced by a set of new species, and then another, and then another.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-1">Types</p>
            <p class="text-md mt-1">**Primary Succession** occurs when species start to replace an area that was left totally bare</p>
            <p class="text-md mt-1">**Secondary Succession** occurs when an existing community is cleared by something that leaves the soil intact</p>

            <p class="text-3xl mt-8">Human Disturbance</p>
            <p class="text-md mt-2">Human activities such as trawling, deforestation, agriculture, and industry are the main drivers of ecosystem disturbance nowadays</p>
