            <p class="text-md mt-2">Dominant species are the species that are either the most abundant or have the highest biomass. Hypothesis suggest that they have a competitive edge in resource usage compared to other species. The death of a dominant species can drastically effect the whole ecosystem</p>

            <p class="text-md mt-2">Keystone species are not dominant, but they usually occupy a specific niche that makes them important</p>
